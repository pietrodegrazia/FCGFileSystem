## FCGFileSystem
Computer Graphics' final challenge @ INF UFRGS 2015/2

## Proposal
Create a visual representation of a file system.

## Requirements
- The visualization must have 3D representation.
- The file-folder hierarchy must be shown somehow.
- Directories and files must have different representations.
- Must allow navigation in the file system such as Windows Explorer, Finder, etc.

## Technical requirements
The visualization must be created using C/C++ and OpenGL, using Windows or Linux in case of classic OpenGL or Modern OpenGL, or WebGL, allowing to run it on the browser.

## To run
- You can select the root folder setting the constant "kRootFolder" in FileManager.hpp.
- In order to use the floor texture you must set the path in Render.cpp, line 35.
